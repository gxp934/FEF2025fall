            <h2>How the Cosmic Crew Came Together </h2>
            <p>It all started at the <a href="https://starwalk.space/en/news/what-is-space">Galactic Academy of Exploration</a>, a prestigious space institute orbiting the neutral moon of Zephara. Every cycle, the Academy hosted the Interplanetary Exchange Program, inviting young explorers from across the galaxy to train together in diplomacy, survival, and starship piloting.</p>
            <ul><!--bold <b> vs strong <strong> es la que deberia de usar para accesibility-->
                <li> <b>Nariko</b> arrived from Verdara with a backpack full of homemade gadgets and a dream of mapping the uncharted nebulae.</li>
                <li> <strong>Jax</strong>, Earth’s loudest and proudest recruit, was more interested in the Academy’s zero-gravity skatepark than its lectures.</li>
                <li> <strong>Ariya</strong>, quiet and observant, came from Lunara to study cosmic phenomena and ancient star languages.</li>
            </ul>
               
            
            <p> 
               They were assigned to the same dorm pod—Unit 7B—and at first, it was chaos. Jax’s music clashed with Ariya’s meditation rituals, and Nariko kept rewiring the pod’s lighting system to simulate Verdaran sunsets.
            </p>

            <p> <!--<i> vs <em> emphasis-->
            <em>But everything changed during the Academy’s annual Asteroid Survival Simulation. Their pod was dropped on a rogue asteroid and told to survive for 72 hours with limited supplies. While other teams panicked, these three found their rhythm:</em>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Nariko built a solar-powered shelter from scrap metal.</li>
                <li>Ariya deciphered the asteroid’s magnetic field to locate safe zones.</li>
                <li>Jax kept morale high, cracking jokes and rallying the team through meteor showers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                They not only survived—they thrived. And when they returned, they were offered a real mission: a ship of their own, and a license to explore the galaxy together. 
                Thus, The Crescent Nomad was born—and so was their legendary friendship.</p>
